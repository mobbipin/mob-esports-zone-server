# MOB ESPORTS ZONE - Backend API

A backend API for the MOB ESPORTS ZONE web application built with Hono, Bun runtime, Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), Cloudflare R2, and JWT authentication.

## Features

- üîê JWT Authentication with role-based access control
- üë• Player and Team Management
- üèÜ Tournament CRUD and Bracket Management
- üì∞ Posts/News Feed
- üìÅ File Uploads to Cloudflare R2
- üéØ Admin Panel for Tournament Management

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun + Cloudflare Workers
- **Framework**: Hono
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **ORM**: Direct SQL queries (optimized for D1)
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Validation**: Zod

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

2. Set up environment variables in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[vars]
JWT_SECRET = "your-secret-key"
ADMIN_REGISTRATION_CODE = "MOB_ADMIN_2024"  # Change this for production
```

3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
bun run deploy
```

## Admin Registration

To register an admin account, you need to provide the admin registration code:

### Register Admin API
```bash
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@mobesports.com",
  "password": "securepassword123",
  "role": "admin",
  "username": "admin",
  "displayName": "Admin User",
  "adminCode": "MOB_ADMIN_2024"
}
```

**Important**: 
- The `adminCode` field is **required** when registering as an admin
- Default admin code is `MOB_ADMIN_2024` (change this in production)
- Only users with the correct admin code can register as admins
- Regular player registration doesn't require the admin code

### Register Player API
```bash
POST /auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "player",
  "username": "player1",
  "displayName": "Player One"
}
```

## API Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": { ... },  // Optional: response data
  "message": "Success message"  // Optional: success message
}
```

### Error Response

## Security Notes

- Change the default admin registration code in production
- Use strong JWT secrets
- Implement rate limiting for production
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Use HTTPS in production

```txt
npm install
npm run dev
```

```txt
npm run deploy
```

[For generating/synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#types):

```txt
npm run cf-typegen
```

Pass the `CloudflareBindings` as generics when instantiation `Hono`:

```ts
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>()
```
